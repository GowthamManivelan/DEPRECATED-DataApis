#Markit On Demand - Data APIs

_Play with some real market data, have fun and show off. Send us your creation._

We have a few APIs for you to play around with, and weâ€™re working to add some more. Details on how to use the Lookup API, Snap Quote API and the Timeseries API for a historical pricing dataset [can be found here](http://dev.markitondemand.com). We have a full set of documentation available, too, so put on a pot of coffee and enjoy.

This repository contains a couple usage examples to get you started, but you should visit [dev.markitondemand.com](http://dev.markitondemand.com/) for full details and docs.
